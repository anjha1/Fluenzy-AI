              FluenzyAI offers flexible pricing so you can match your preparation intensity to your goals. Whether you are starting
              with mock interviews with AI or preparing for a high-stakes transition, each plan includes core AI Interview Coach
              capabilities. You get guided HR interview preparation, targeted technical interview training, and English speaking
              practice with AI that mirrors real interview scenarios. This makes FluenzyAI a practical AI interview preparation
              platform for candidates who want consistent progress rather than sporadic practice.
